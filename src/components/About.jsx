  <p>I'm Kiran Reddy, a committed computer scientist with a Master's degree from the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. My background includes a lot of work in software development 
    and machine learning. I've achieved a lot academically and have used cutting-edge technologies to significantly impact various projects. These include monitoring the environment for NASA, 
    developing software backends for NTT Data, and creating new solutions for Zensar Technologies and DataLore Labs.</p>

  <p>My professional life is shaped by deep knowledge in technology and a strong desire to use technology to make a real difference. 
    One of the main highlights of my career is my work with NASA's Nova Project, where I helped make big improvements in detecting air quality 
    using machine learning, improving how we monitor the environment on Earth and beyond.</p>

  <p>In software development, I am skilled in handling everything from building complete applications to managing complex backend operations 
    and integrating data. I work with a wide range of tools and programming languages, including .NET, Python, C#, and SQL. My projects focus on 
    designing for users and using data to make things better and more efficient.</p>

  <p>I also actively contribute to academic discussions, having written papers and a book on subjects from machine learning in healthcare to the technical 
    details of networks in the Internet of Things. My forward-thinking approach to technology and solving real 
    problems makes me a valuable member of any team, always pushing for innovation and excellence in everything I do.</p>
